# Remaining To-Do for Pong until 12/1/24 
- Switch out the space bar to start the game and have it on a timer. 
  - So after someone sores, the game should wait x seconds and then send the ball towards the player who was just scored on. 
    - read about timers in either python or pygame (scheduled) and figure out how I might implement.
- Implement a scoring system.
  - figure out how many points are needed to win. 
  - Once a player wins, display "playerX won" and ask if they want to play again.

# To-Do for 1/1/24 
- Host pong online. 
- Add account info and leader boards.
